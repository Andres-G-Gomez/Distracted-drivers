<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

  The leading cause of fatal accidents in the U.S. is due to distracted driving. Although self-driving technologies are becoming commercially prevalent in the U.S., drivers are expected to be fully alert, prepared to take over at any moment. Many newer vehicles are equipped with driver alert systems, which monitor a driverâ€™s behavior either through data collected from external sensors or through a camera system and warn or alert the driver when unsafe behavior is detected. This work will apply and compare various deep learning models to the publicly available State Farm Distracted Driver Detection dataset as well as estimate tighter risk bounds of false positives for distracted drivers than would generally be obtained through confidence intervals. Risk bound characterizations, like binomial proportion confidence intervals, will be determined.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Here, list all libraries, packages and other dependencies that need to be installed to run your project. Include library versions and how they should be installed if a special requirement is needed.

For example, this is how you would list them:
* Numpy 1.23.0
  ```sh
  pip install numpy 1.23.0
  ```
* Tensorflow 2.9.1
  ```sh
  pip install tensorflow 2.9.1
  ```
* Pandas 1.1.3
  ```sh
  pip install pandas 1.1.3
  ```
* Sklearn 0.23.2
  ```sh
  pip install scikit-learn 0.23.2
  ```
* Skimage 0.17.2
  ```sh
  pip install scikit-image 0.17.2
  ```
* Statsmodels 0.12.0
  ```sh
  pip install statsmodels 0.12.0
  ```
 
### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Andres-G-Gomez/distracted-drivers
   ```
2. Setup (and activate) your environment
  ```sh
  conda env create -f requirements.yml
  ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Roughly 2500 images were sampled from the [State Farm Distracted Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data). The images were then reshaped to 300x300, flattened, and saved to an array named "data_small.npy." The respective labels, distracted or alert, were also saved in a datafile named "labels_small.npy." The script used to train the CNN calls on these datafiles. The Jupyter notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/Andres-G-Gomez/distracted-drivers/blob/main/final_CNN_etc.ipynb).
